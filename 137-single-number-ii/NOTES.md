The usual bit manipulation code is bit hard to get and replicate. I like to think about the number in 32 bits and just count how many 1s are there in each bit, and sum %= 3 will clear it once it reaches 3. After running for all the numbers for each bit, if we have a 1, then that 1 belongs to the single number, we can simply move it back to its spot by doing ans |= sum << i;
​
This has complexity of O(32n), which is essentially O(n) and very easy to think and implement. Plus, you get a general solution for any times of occurrence. Say all the numbers have 5 times, just do sum %= 5.
**awesome**
public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
int ans = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
int sum = 0;
for(int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
if(((nums[j] >> i) & 1) == 1) {
sum++;
sum %= 3;
}
}
if(sum != 0) {
ans |= sum << i;
}
}
return ans;
}
