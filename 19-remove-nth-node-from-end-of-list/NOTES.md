**best approach pepcoding:**----*it avoids you from calculating size*
1: take 2 pointers fast and slow--f and s.
2:move f pointers n steps i.e. to n+1 th position.
3:now move both the f and s pointer 1 step forword , till the f pointet reached the tail.
4: now slow pointer is at the correct node.

**my approach:** take two pointers both at start ,now move 1st pointer n step ,after that simultaneously move both the pointer till 1st pointer reached the end
