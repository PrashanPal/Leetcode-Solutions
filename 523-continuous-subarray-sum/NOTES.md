[1000000000]
1000000000-->because of this value of k ,we can't use an array for storing remainder and calculating there frequencies
​
[1000000000] because this input we cant use array ,we should use hashmap ,because if we use array then we have to create a remainder array of lenght 10000000000 which is foolishness , **this the beauty of leetcode**
1000000000
