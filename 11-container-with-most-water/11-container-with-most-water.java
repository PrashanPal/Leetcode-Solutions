    //In this approach will use two pointers i and j where i =0 and j = arr.length - 1. So the water will be      ( j - i ) * min(ht[i], ht[j]). Now we need to decide when i will increase and when j will decrease to        find the next containerâ€™s water.
    
    // If we increment in i then there are two cases: one is maybe the height increases then the chances of       most water will increase , second it may be height decrease then the container will not contain most        water. If we decrement in j then there are two cases: one is maybe the height increases then the chances      of    containing most water will increase , second it may be height decrease then the container will not        contain most water. Now the cases are: If the height at j index is greater than the height at i index      than we need to increase the index i by one so that the possibility of getting most water will increase      and same for height at j is smaller than height at i this time we need to change j by decreasing it by 1.
